Process: A PIR sensor, hooked to an Arduino, sends serial messages to Processing which then writes to a txt file and is read by Flash.

1. Unzip arduino_to_flash.zip and place folder in Processing sketches folder
2. Setup your Arduino and PIR sensor according to the diagram at: http://www.ladyada.net/learn/sensors/pir.html
3. Upload pir_sensor_arduino.pde sketch to Arduino
4. Run sensor_to_flash.pde sketch in Processing
5. Run sensor_to_flash.swf in Flash or Flash Player
